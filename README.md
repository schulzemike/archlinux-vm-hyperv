# Vagrant project for my development machine

This Vagrant configuration uses my own created [basebox](https://github.com/schulzemike/archlinux-basebox-hyperv).

## Usage
- Create a Vagrantfile from the provided template file
- The ssh key is already referenced inside the Vagrantfile that is included in the box-file, so that is not required to configure it here
